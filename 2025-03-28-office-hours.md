# 2025-03-28

Roughly the following was discussed:

- Taking a focus on clack to clean up issues, PRs, etc
    - Using the [board](https://github.com/orgs/bombshell-dev/projects/1/views/1)
- See if there is a library which does most CLI text calculations in one
    - e.g. text width, terminal size, text wrapping, etc.
- Try out creating a hard-coded layout using clack
    - e.g. use a select list in a 2 column layout, left = select, right = info of what is selected
- Continue sharing updates in new bsky profile
- Check if taffy wasm PR is still likely to move forward
